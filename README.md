# Wordlister
A tool that generates wordlists using realistic human patterns

The Fast one is efficient with creating large wordlists (so use it if you have a lot of words to use)
The Strong one makes every possible combination (very good when you have a smaller amount of words because if you have the right words, it basically guarantees a succesful crack)
